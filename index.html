        <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the
          red junglefowl. As one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a
          population of more than 19 billion in 2011, there are more chickens in the world
          than any other species of bird or domestic animal.</p>
